# Corner Grocer Item Frequency Tracker (CS 210 Project Three)

A C++ console application that reads a daily purchase log and produces item frequency insights for store layout decisions. The program supports menu-based lookup, full frequency reporting, and a text histogram, and it generates an automatic backup file (`frequency.dat`).

---

## Project Overview

**Problem:** Corner Grocer needs to know how often each produce item is purchased so they can reorganize their produce section for a more effective customer layout.

**Solution:** This program analyzes an input text file of purchased items (one item per line), counts frequencies using a `std::map`, and provides:
- Single-item frequency lookup
- Full frequency list output
- Histogram visualization (using `*`)
- Automatic backup file output (`frequency.dat`) at program start

**Key Features**
- Class-based design (`GroceryTracker`) with clear public/private separation  
- File I/O (read input log, write backup file)  
- Input validation for menu options (defensive programming)  
- Normalization for consistent item matching (trim + lowercase)  
- Simple suggestion behavior for plural/singular (`apple` → suggests `apples`, when applicable)

## How to Run

### Expected Folder Layout

├── src/
│   ├── main.cpp
│   ├── GroceryTracker.cpp
│   └── GroceryTracker.h

### Run Notes (Working Directory)
This project is typically configured to run with the **working directory set to `data/`** so the input file can be referenced by name:
- `CornerGrocerInput.txt`

When the program runs, it writes:
- `frequency.dat` (backup output) to the current working directory.

### Build + Run (Visual Studio / MSVC)
**Recommended:** Visual Studio 2022 (Desktop development with C++)  
- Open the solution/project (or folder)
- Build and run the program

**VS Code + MSVC (optional):**
- Run VS Code from the *Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt*
- Build with an MSVC task that compiles both `main.cpp` and `GroceryTracker.cpp`

## Portfolio Reflection (CS 210 Module Eight Journal)

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For my portfolio artifact, I selected **Project Three: Corner Grocer Item Frequency Tracker**. The program reads a daily purchase log and calculates how often each item appears. It provides a menu-driven interface to look up a single item’s frequency, print all item frequencies, and display a histogram of purchase counts. The program also creates a backup file (`frequency.dat`) automatically at startup.  
This solves a real operational problem: Corner Grocer wants to reorganize their produce section, and frequency data supports better layout decisions by highlighting which items are purchased most often.

### What did you do particularly well?
I did particularly well in **program structure and readability**. I separated responsibilities by keeping `main.cpp` focused on user interaction and control flow while placing file processing, counting, and reporting logic inside the `GroceryTracker` class. I also used `std::map` effectively for frequency counting and implemented input normalization so user searches are case-insensitive and consistent.

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance the program by improving the suggestion/matching logic beyond simple pluralization (adding/removing “s”). Supporting additional common patterns (like `y → ies`) would improve usability without changing stored data. I could also improve output formatting for readability and extend error reporting to provide clearer troubleshooting details. These improvements would make the program more user-friendly, resilient, and easier to maintain.

### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part was ensuring file paths, build configuration, and multi-file compilation worked reliably (compiling and linking both `.cpp` files into one executable). I overcame this by validating the working directory behavior, ensuring consistent build settings, and testing outputs against known counts. Tools and resources I’m adding to my support network include stronger familiarity with MSVC build workflows, standard library references for containers and file I/O, and a repeatable debugging approach that separates compile, link, and runtime issues.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project strengthened skills that apply directly to other coursework and real-world development:
- Class design and encapsulation
- Standard library container usage (`std::map`)
- File input/output and formatted output generation
- Input validation and defensive programming
- Separation of concerns and modular program structure

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made the program maintainable by separating the UI/control flow from the business logic, using clear naming conventions, and adding inline comments that explain intent. Centralizing normalization logic prevents duplicated string handling across the program. This structure makes the code adaptable because new features (additional menu options, different output formats, expanded matching rules) can be added inside `GroceryTracker` without rewriting the main menu loop.
