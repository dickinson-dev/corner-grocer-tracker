# Corner Grocer Item Frequency Tracker (CS 210 Project Three)

A C++ console application that reads a daily purchase log and produces item frequency insights for store layout decisions. The program supports menu-based lookup, full frequency reporting, and a text histogram, and it generates an automatic backup file (`frequency.dat`).

---

## Project Overview

**Problem:** Corner Grocer needs to know how often each produce item is purchased so they can reorganize their produce section for a more effective customer layout.

**Solution:** This program analyzes an input text file of purchased items (one item per line), counts frequencies using a `std::map`, and provides:
- Single-item frequency lookup
- Full frequency list output
- Histogram visualization (using `*`)
- Automatic backup file output (`frequency.dat`) at program start

**Key Features**
- Class-based design (`GroceryTracker`) with clear public/private separation  
- File I/O (read input log, write backup file)  
- Input validation for menu options (defensive programming)  
- Normalization for consistent item matching (trim + lowercase)  
- Simple suggestion behavior for plural/singular (`apple` → suggests `apples`, when applicable)

## How to Run

### Expected Folder Layout
```text
CornerGrocer/
├── src/
│   ├── main.cpp
│   ├── GroceryTracker.cpp
│   └── GroceryTracker.h
├── data/
│   ├── CornerGrocerInput.txt
│   └── frequency.dat        (generated by the program)
├── docs/
│   ├── design-notes.md
│   └── architecture.md
└── screenshots/
```

### Run Notes (Working Directory)
This project is configured to run with the **working directory set to `data/`** so the input file can be referenced by name:
- `CornerGrocerInput.txt`

When the program runs, it writes:
- `frequency.dat` (backup output) to the current working directory.

### Build + Run (Visual Studio / MSVC)
**Recommended:** Visual Studio 2022 (Desktop development with C++)  
- Open the solution/project (or folder)
- Build and run the program

**VS Code + MSVC (optional):**
- Run VS Code from the *Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt*
- Build with an MSVC task that compiles both `main.cpp` and `GroceryTracker.cpp`

## Portfolio Reflection (CS 210 Module Eight Journal)

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For my portfolio artifact, I selected **Project Three: Corner Grocer Item Frequency Tracker**. The program reads a daily purchase log (`CornerGrocerInput.txt`) and calculates how often each item appears. It provides a menu that supports (1) searching for a single item’s frequency, (2) printing all item frequencies, (3) printing a text-based histogram, and (4) exiting. The program also generates a backup file (`frequency.dat`) automatically at startup.  

This project solves a real operational problem: Corner Grocer wants to rearrange the produce section, and frequency data helps inform layout decisions by identifying the most frequently purchased items.

### What did you do particularly well?
I did particularly well in **code organization and readability**. I separated responsibilities by keeping `main.cpp` focused on user interaction and menu control flow, while the `GroceryTracker` class handled file processing, frequency counting, and reporting outputs. I also used the C++ standard library effectively (`std::map` for frequency tracking) and added normalization (trim + lowercase) so user searches match consistently.

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance the code by expanding the suggestion logic beyond simple pluralization (adding/removing “s”) to handle additional common plural forms. I could also strengthen runtime messaging (more descriptive file/path errors) and refine output formatting for readability. These improvements would make the program more user-friendly, more resilient to inconsistent input data, and easier to troubleshoot and maintain.

### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part was ensuring a reliable workflow for file handling and multi-file compilation (compiling and linking multiple `.cpp` files into one executable). I overcame this by validating working-directory behavior, building incrementally, and verifying outputs against known frequencies. Tools and resources I’m adding to my support network include MSVC/Visual Studio build workflows, standard library documentation for containers and file streams, and a repeatable debugging approach that separates compile, link, and runtime issues.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project reinforced several transferable skills:
- Designing a class with a clear public interface and private data
- Using standard library containers (`std::map`) for counting and lookup tasks
- File input/output with formatted output files
- Input validation and defensive programming
- Separation of concerns to keep code modular and easier to extend

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made the program maintainable by separating UI logic from business logic, using consistent naming conventions, and adding inline comments that explain intent. I centralized input normalization to avoid repeated string-cleaning logic. This structure makes the program adaptable because changes like adding new menu options, adjusting output formatting, or improving matching rules can be implemented within `GroceryTracker` without rewriting the main control flow.
